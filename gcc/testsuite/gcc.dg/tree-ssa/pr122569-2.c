/* Test that the forwprop DeBruijn CLZ matcher recognizes the 64-bit
   OR-cascade + magic-multiply + table-lookup idiom used in
   Stockfish-style bitboard msb() functions and many portable-C
   codebases that predate __builtin_clzll.

   The critical edge case is magictable[63] == 63 (the MSB reached
   when the OR-cascade input has bit 63 set, so all 64 bits are set).
   The validator's CLZ checkfn computed (1 << (data + 1)) - 1 to
   simulate that all-ones value, which invoked shift-by-64 UB when
   data was 63, causing the transformation to be rejected for any
   valid 64-bit DeBruijn CLZ table.  */
